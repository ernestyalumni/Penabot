Penabot - track your hours, focused and wasted time

## Inspiration

I keep track of the time I use or waste daily by hour by spreadsheet - I want to do that with a chat bot!

Former CEO and business coach Dan Pe√±a has a system of weekly reports based upon the number of hours spent focused on working towards long-term goals and number of hours wasted in a week.  Hence the name "Penabot" and why I keep track of my hours.  

## What it does

Using LUIS to do Natural Language Processing (NLP), the chat bot records what the user has done into the builtin calendar.  

## How I built it

I followed Daniel Egan's Microsoft Bot Framework tutorial.  

## Challenges I ran into

Having to learn node.js

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Adapting builtin.calendar to my needs from builtin.alarm.

## What I learned

(very) Basics of Microsoft Bot Framework 

## What's next for PenaBot - track your hours, focused and wasted time

Do persistence with PenaBot and output out to text or csv file data.  

## Psychology

Keeping track of time I use and focus or waste helped me change my behavior for the better, to obtain peak performance, optimize performance.  

## Example

"Dealing with the epically aggressive schedules and Musk's expectations has required SpaceX's engineers to develop a variety of survival techniques.  Musk often asks for highly detailed proposals for how projects will be accomplished.  The employees have learned never to break the time needed to accomplish something down into months or weeks.  Musk wants day-by-day and hour-by-hour forecasts and sometimes even minute-by-minute countdowns, and the fallout from missed schedules is severe.  "You had to put in when you would go to the bathroom," Brogran said. "I'm like, 'Elon, sometimes people need to take a long dump.'"
